Predicting one's destination is a fundamental component of understanding human movement. Expanding the use of destination prediction is difficult due to the fact that training and test data frequently differ, and when a prediction model trained on one area is applied to another with a different data distribution, the accuracy is at best subpar. The aim of the IEEE Big Data Cup 2022 is to build a robust and generalizable model that can efficiently predict an individual's daily destination based on attributes and facts collected from four urban areas in Japan. Additionally, the models trained with the previous data will be used to predict the destination for a new metropolitan area. Our team have taken a different approach altogether for solving this challenge. Our method uses two different types of neural networks. We first try to find the trip type of the person using convolutional neural network and then after apply graph neural network on that for determining the final destination of the person and this method achieved some relatively good accuracy. ![image](https://github.com/akash3patel/People_Flow_Dataset/assets/147214109/93862bd8-f593-47a2-99ad-97b33255d1d4)
